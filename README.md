# Gene-Editing-Database
Full-Stack Web Development Project. During the first semester of the second year, three of my colleagues and I created a database using MySQL regarding Gene Editing, with 20 tables and relations between them, as well as created a web application for the database using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
