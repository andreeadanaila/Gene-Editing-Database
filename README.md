# Gene-Editing-Database
Full-Stack Web Development Project. During the first semester of the second year, three of my colleagues and I created a database using MySQL regarding Gene Editing, with 20 tables and relations between them, and a web application for the database using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was done over three months, with the work equally divided among us. We initially created the basic ERD of the project, containing all 20 tables, the columns, and the relations between them. Then, we created each table using MySQL, with the proper information, foreign keys, and primary keys. Finally, we created a web interface for the database, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website gives an in-depth view of the Gene Editing program we created, the ability to join the program as a participant, and the ability to view certain information from the database.
